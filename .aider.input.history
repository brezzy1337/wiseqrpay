+Hey! It's been awhile but I have made some good progress my current project. I need some help using Zod .superRefine with my WISE_Bussiness_CATEGORIES. I'm not sure if I should reformat that object because it is in a read-only state or if I should try can do a work around in the secondLevelCategory input validation.

+I'm getting this error which mean I think have I have change `WISE_BUSINESS_CATEGORIES` to get out of a readonly state:
+
+Conversion of type 'readonly ["CHARITY_NON_PROFIT", "CHARITY_ALL_ACTIVITIES"] | readonly ["CONSULTING_IT_BUSINESS_SERVICES", "ADVERTISING_AND_MARKETING", "ARCHITECTURE", "COMPANY_ESTABLISHMENT_FORMATION_SERVICES", ... 14 more ..., "MAINTENANCE_SERVICES"] | ... 9 more ... | readonly [...]' to type '[string, ...string[]]' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
+  The type 'readonly ["OTHER", "OTHER_NOT_LISTED_ABOVE"]' is 'readonly' and cannot be assigned to the mutable type '[string, ...string[]]'.ts(2352)

+I actually think we overcomplecated the problem my main issue is stated below:
+```Property 'parent' does not exist on type 'RefinementCtx'.```
+
+This error occurs in TypeScript when you're trying to access a property called parent on an object of type RefinementCtx, but the RefinementCtx type doesn't have a parent property defined in its type definition.
